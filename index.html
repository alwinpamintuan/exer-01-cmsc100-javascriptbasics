		<h4> Nickname:</h4>
		<p> Alwin </p>

		<h4> Favorite CMSC subject so far and why </h4>
		<p> My favorite CMSC subject so far is CMSC 12 because Python is the best. <p>

		<h4> Favorite GE so far and why </h4>
		<p> Ethics 1, because we were forced to think more critical of moral or ethical dilemmas that would seem obvious at first. </p>

		<h4> Favorite PL and why </h4>
		<p> Python. As a very lazy person, Python is the only language I know so far that enables me to write very short code because of its inbuilt functions. </p>

		<h4> Favorite Food </h4>
		<p> Sisig and Kare-kare </p>

		<h4> Hobbies </h4>
		<ul>
			<li> Watching videos </li>
			<li> Viewing memes </li>
		</ul>
